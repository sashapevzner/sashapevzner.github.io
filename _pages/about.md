#### About me

Hi! I am a Zelevinsky postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University studying commutative algebra, invariant theory, and combinatorics. I received my PhD in 2024 from the University of Minnesota, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Victor Reiner](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/). Broadly I enjoy working in the field of commutative algebra, and I often use free resolutions to study modules with natural symmetries.

Below are some more specific topics that I like (not an exhaustive list!)
  * invariant theory of finite groups
  * minimal free resolutions, finite and infinite
  * representation stability and FI modules
  * working over characteristic 0, p, and maybe not a field!
  * algebraic geometry (learning it bit-by-bit)

#### Papers

1. [Symmetric group fixed quotients of polynomial rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13377) <br>
*Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, Volume 228, Issue 4 (2024)*

2. [Equivariant resolutions over Veronese rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16342)    
with Ayah Almousa, Michael Perlman, Victor Reiner, and Keller VandeBogert <br>
*Journal of the London Mathematical Society (2024)*

3. [Alexander duals of symmetric simplicial complexes and Stanley--Reisner ideals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14132) (submitted)   
with Ayah Almousa, Kaitlin Bruegge, Martina Juhnke-Kubitzke, and Uwe Nagel
