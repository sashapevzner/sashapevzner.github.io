#### About me

Hi! I am a mathematician studying commutative algebra, invariant theory, and combinatorics. In May 2024, I completed the defense for my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota, under the advisement of [Vic Reiner](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/). In Fall 2024, I plan to join Northeastern University as a Zelevinsky Postdoctoral Fellow. Broadly I enjoy working in the field of commutative algebra, and I often use free resolutions to study modules with natural symmetries.

Below are some more specific topics that I like (not an exhaustive list!)
  * invariant theory of finite groups
  * minimal free resolutions, finite and infinite
  * representation stability and FI modules
  * working over characteristic 0, p, and maybe not a field!
  * algebraic geometry (learning it bit-by-bit)
