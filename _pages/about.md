#### About me

Hi! I'm a 5th year PhD student at UMN working with [Vic Reiner](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/). Broadly I enjoy working in the field of commutative algebra, and I often use free resolutions to study modules with natural symmetries.

Below are some more specific topics that I like (not an exhaustive list!)
  * invariant theory of finite groups
  * minimal free resolutions, finite and infinite
  * representation stability and FI modules
  * working over characteristic 0, p, and maybe not a field!
  * algebraic geometry (learning it bit-by-bit)

**I am on the academic job market in Fall 2023.**
