#### About me

Hi! I'm a 4th year PhD student at UMN working with [Vic Reiner](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/). Broadly I enjoy working in the field of commutative algebra, and I often use free resolutions to study modules with natural symmetries.

Below are some more specific topics that I like (not an exhaustive list!)
  * invariant theory of finite groups
  * minimal free resolutions, finite and infinite
  * representation stability and FI modules
  * working over characteristic 0, p, and maybe not a field!
  * algebraic geometry (learning it bit-by-bit)

I will be on the academic job market in Fall 2023.

#### Papers

1. [Symmetric group fixed quotients of polynomial rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13377) (submitted)

2. [Equivariant resolutions over Veronese rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16342) (submitted)   
with Ayah Almousa, Michael Perlman, Victor Reiner, and Keller VandeBogert

3. [Alexander duals of symmetric simplicial complexes and Stanley--Reisner ideals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14132) (submitted)   
with Ayah Almousa, Kaitlin Bruegge, Martina Juhnke-Kubitzke, and Uwe Nagel

#### Happenings

* Elise Catania, Sylvester Zhang, and I organized [MRWAC 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/mrwac2023/), a research workshop for University of Minnesota graduate students, alumni, and postdocs.
* Aaron Li, Lina Liu, Michelle Mastrianni, Mahrud Sayrafi, and I run the [Directed Reading Program](https://z.umn.edu/mathdrp) at UMN. Please fill out our interest form if you'd like to stay updated on the next application season.
